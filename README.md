# Super Cozy Catnap Time (SCCT)

> Your Mac will take a 20 second break every 20 minutes. You should too.

Your Mac is now an introvert that needs "me-time" every once in a while. Take this opportunity to rest your eyes and self-care. Based on the American Optometric Association's 20-20-20 recommendations to:

- Take a 20 second break
- Every 20 minutes
- To look at something 20 feet away

to prevent eye strain and computer vision syndrome from prolonged screen use.
